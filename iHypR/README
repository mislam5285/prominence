This is the iterative hyperedge ranking (iHypR) algorithm, which infers actors' prominence in heterogeneous networks by utilizing hyperedges' structure of objects.

How to compile:
===============
The program was written in C++ using the Netbeans 6.9 IDE (http://www.netbeans.org) on an Opensuse 11.4 64-bit computer. You should get a compressed netbeans project folder. 

Extract the compressed folder to a convenient place, and get into 'iHypR' folder. Type 'make' command in a terminal within the folder. After these steps, you should get an executable 'ihypr'. There is a symbol link to the executable in the folder for quick access to the program.

The program was successfully compiled and ran on OpenSuse 11.4, Ubuntu 10.4, and Mac OS X 10.5.x.

How to run:
===========
In a terminal, type the executable name, following by a network and optional 0 or 1. For example:

ihypr net.txt

ihypr net.txt 1

The first command make the program to run with A-O-H relations, while the second only uses A-H relations.

The results will be stored in a text file named 'actor_n.txt', where n is an integer for number of iterations. Each line of the results is a pair of actor name and score, tab delimited.

The algorithm is very similar to HITS, however, it is not linear. Therefore, for some networks, it may not converge. In such a case, the program will stop at 1000 iterations. Usually, it takes less 100 iterations in most networks.


Input format:
=============
The program requires strict format of input file:

1) The first line must be max_actor_id max_object_id max_hyperedge_id.
2) Each of the rest lines must be actor_id object_id hyperedge_id.
3) All ids must be positive integers starting with 1.
